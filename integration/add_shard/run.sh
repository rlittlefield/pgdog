# Integration test: ADD SHARD — provision the shard declared with
# provisioning = true while omni writes keep flowing, then cut over.
#
# Requires:
#   - local postgres at port 5432 with databases pgdog1, pgdog2, shard_0
#     (created by integration/setup.sh)
#   - wal_level = logical, max_replication_slots >= 8
#
# Leaves shard_0 wiped (it plays the empty new shard); rerun
# integration/setup.sh before suites or live unit tests that expect the
# standard test schema there.
